**Project Title:** Titanic Survival Prediction

**Overview:**
This project focused on building a machine learning model to predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on factors like age, gender, and class. The goal was to analyze the dataset, preprocess the data, and use logistic regression to create an accurate predictive model.

**Objectives:**
- To analyze and clean the Titanic dataset.
- To identify key features that influence passenger survival.
- To build a predictive model using logistic regression.
- To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Exploration:** 
   - Analyzed the dataset using **Pandas** to explore distributions and relationships.
   - Visualized key patterns and relationships with **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values, especially in columns like age and embarked.
   - Converted categorical variables like gender and embarked using encoding techniques.
   - Scaled numerical features for better model performance.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Identified important features such as passenger class, gender, and age that significantly impact survival.
   - Created new features like family size to capture additional patterns.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Implemented **Logistic Regression** as the primary model for predicting survival.
   - Used train-test splits for model validation and optimized model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the logistic regression model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualized model performance using confusion matrix plots.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Logistic Regression (from Scikit-learn)
